# stock-analysis
# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project 
In module 2, we were introduced to Steve, a recent grad with a degree in finance.  We were also tasked with helping Steve analyze an Excel file containing stock data from 2017 and 2018.  Now, Steve needs help analyzing the dataset of the entire stock market over the last few years.  To do this, I first used the Microsoft Visual Basics Editor also known as Microsoft Visual Basics for Applications (VBA) to refactor the provided VBA script. I then collected the required data and tested the code’s performance.  In the end, stock data from 2018 and refactor data from 2018 were compared.  

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to refactor the VBA script for a stock dataset from 2018 and to measure this VBA script’s performance.
